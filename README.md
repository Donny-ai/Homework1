# Pioneering AI in Visual Media

## Overview and Origin

* Name: Metaphysic Inc.

* Incorporated 2021

* Founded by Chris Ume, Kevin Ume, Martin Adams, and Thomas Graham [^2]

* The company's seeds were sown when co-founder Chris Umé joined a Discord server with other researchers, technologists and artists focused on synthetic media. Their experiments led to collaborative parodies and educational material such as #DeepTomCruise. Eventually they formalized as Metaphysic, an organization meant to advance the cutting edge while advocating for ethical AI. [^1]

* Received $7.5M via seed funding [^2]

## Business Activities:

* __What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?__
The company's software reconstructs low-resolution film, makes natural-looking facial representations, enables editing of expressions, facial characteristics, or full faces, including live faceswaps or de-aging, and enables content makers to use artificial intelligence in their work. They also allow people to create and own their hyperreal digital avatar to use in the metaverse. [^3][^4][^5]

* __Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)__
Intended customers include the film industry, content creators, and all social media users[^3]. The US film industry has a net worth of roughly $92 billion[^7]. The content creation industry is estimated to be worth 19 billion[^6]. Metaphysic's advantage is being at the leading edge of synthetic face reproduction with the effect of creating the first viral celebrity deepfake and working with major production studios such as Miramax and NBC.[^3][^12]

* __Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?__ 
Metaphysic primarily uses autoencoders, one of three frameworks for generating synthetic human faces. Autoencoding rests on the shoulders of larger fields such as generative AI, machine learning, neural nets, and computer vision, therefore Metaphysic is well-versed in these fields as well.[^8][^11]

## Landscape:

* __What domain or industry is the company in?__
VFX, Deepfakes, Metaverse
* __What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?__
AI, globalization, virtual production, cloud computing, new VFX software tools, real-time rendering, VR, streaming services, game engines[^13][^14]
* __What are the other major companies in this domain?__
DGene (de-age characters in film), Imagination Engines (general neural nets), DNEG, Dreamworks, Digital Doman, Animal Logic, (all VFX in film industry), Rephrase.ai (AI-generated presentations), Marz, Deep Voodoo (deepfake tools for film).[^9][^10]

## Results

* __What has been the business impact of this company so far?__
    - First viral deepfake of a celebrity
    - Partnered with Creative Artists Agency (CAA) to create deals for artists using AI in film, TV, and entertainment
    - Hired by Miramax to de-age Tom Hanks and Robin Wright for select scenes in upcoming film *Here*
    - Created live deepfakes of Elvis, Simon Cowell, and other celebrites on America's Got Talent
    - Built the infrastructure for anyone to create a synthetic avatar of themselves to use in the metaverse[^4][^5]
* __What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?__
Interest and partnerships from major industry players, and investment funding. With major partnerships from industry giants and millions in funding, Metaphysic has done quite well in both categories.
* __How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?__
It's difficult to quantify which AI company is performing the best because of how new the domain is, but with many industry firsts and major partnerships Metaphysic is among the leaders of the industry.[^9][^10]

## Recommendations

* __If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)__
    - Branch out to more AI tools for filmmakers and content creators to use.
    - Develop an advanced age filter to age actors in real-time
    - Market their technology even more with other celebrities and celebrity impersonators, while providing education about deepfakes
    - Develop tools to detect deepfakes or to cryptographically watermark deepfakes
* __Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?__
These suggestions would increase Metaphysic's TAM and differentiate them further, while proving they are industry leaders who are also serious about ethics.
* __What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?__
Additional AI tools for filmmakers would likely use an autoencoding framework which is the heart of their current product suite and what DeepFaceLab and FaceSwap, two popular open source solutions, use as well[^8]. Metaphysic is keeping up with other frameworks such as GAN's and NeRF's and may be able to utilize these to do things autoencoding can't currently do[^11]. Developing tools to detect and watermark deepfakes may involve machine learning, GAN's, and cryptography.
