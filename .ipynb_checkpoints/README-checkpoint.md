# Markdown Syntax Examples

## Subheadings with Different Levels

### A Smaller Heading

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text in a simple and intuitive way. It is widely used for creating content on the web, including documentation, README files, and blog posts. Let's explore some common Markdown syntax and see how they are used:

1. **Headers:** Create headings of different levels using hashtags (#). The number of hashtags indicates the heading level. For example, `# Heading 1` creates a top-level heading, while `## Heading 2` creates a subheading.

2. **Emphasis:** Add **emphasis** to text using asterisks (*) or underscores (_). Wrapping text with single asterisks/underscores creates *italics*, and using double asterisks/underscores creates **bold** text.

3. **Links:** Insert links using square brackets [] followed by the URL in parentheses (). For example, `[Visit Shaolin AI](https://shaolin.ai/)` will create a link to OpenAI's website.

    4. **Lists:** Create ordered lists using numbers and unordered lists using dashes (-) or asterisks (*). Indent with four spaces for nested lists.

   - Unordered list item 1
   - Unordered list item 2

5. **Images:** Display images using an exclamation mark (!) followed by square brackets [] containing the alt text and parentheses () containing the image URL. For example, `![Alt text](image_url)`.

6. **Code:** Inline code can be wrapped in backticks (`). For code blocks, use triple backticks (```) at the beginning and end of the code block.

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

7. **Blockquotes:** Use the greater than symbol (>) at the beginning of a line to create blockquotes. They are often used for citations or highlighting important information.

> This is a blockquote.

8. **Horizontal Rule:** Insert a horizontal rule by typing three hyphens (---), three asterisks (***), or three underscores (___) on a separate line.

---

9. **Tables:** Create tables using pipes (|) to separate columns and hyphens (-) to create the header row. Adjust the column width using colons (:).

| Name     | Age |
| -------- | --- |
| John     | 25  |
| Sarah    | 30  |

10. **Escape Characters:** Use a backslash (\) to escape Markdown characters that have special meaning, such as \*, \#, \[.

These examples showcase some of the most commonly used Markdown syntax. Feel free to explore further and experiment with additional Markdown elements to enhance your documents and make them more visually appealing.

Happy Markdown formatting!

# Pioneering AI in Visual Media

## Overview and Origin

* Name: Metaphysic Inc.

* Incorporated 2021

* Founded by Chris Ume, Kevin Ume, Martin Adams, and Thomas Graham

* The seeds for the company were sown when co-founder Chris Umé joined a Discord server with other researchers, technologists and artists focused on synthetic media. Their experiments led to collaborative parodies and educational material such as #DeepTomCruise. Eventually they formalized as Metaphysic, an organization meant to advance the cutting edge while advocating for ethical AI. 

* Received $7.5M via seed funding

## Business Activities:

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The company's software reconstructs low-resolution film, makes natural-looking facial representations, enables editing of expressions, facial characteristics, or full faces, enables content makers to use artificial intelligence in their work. Allows people to create and own their hyperreal digital avatar to use in the metaverse
Creates faceswaps or de-aging in real-time.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Intended customers include the film industry, content creators, and all social media users. The US film industry has a net worth of roughly $92 billion. The content creation industry is estimated to be worth between $16-19 billion. Metaphysic's advantage is being at the leading edge of synthetic face reproduction with the effect of creating the first viral celebrity deepfake and working with major production studios such as Miramax and NBC.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Generative AI, machine learning, neural nets, autoencoders, computer vision

## Landscape:

* What domain or industry is the company in?
VFX, Deepfakes, Metaverse
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this domain?


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
First viral deepfake of a celebrity
Partnered with Creative Artists Agency (CAA) to create deals for artists using AI in film, TV, and entertainment
Hired by Miramax to de-age Tom Hanks and Robin Wright for select scenes in upcoming film *Here*
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
DGene (de-age characters in film), Imagine Engines (VFX in film)

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
